Image Classification Project
This project focuses on image classification using advanced image processing and machine learning techniques. The goal is to accurately classify images into different categories based on their visual content.

Project Overview
The image classification pipeline consists of the following major steps:

Data Preprocessing: The image dataset is preprocessed using filters and techniques such as Gaussian blur, median filtering, and denoising autoencoders. These preprocessing steps help in reducing noise and enhancing the quality of the images.

Feature Extraction: Features are extracted from the preprocessed images using techniques such as SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform), SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features), or CNN-based feature extraction. These features capture important visual information from the images and facilitate robust and accurate classification.

Registration and Transformation: Advanced registration and transformation techniques, such as Homography-based registration and perspective transformation, are applied to align the images. These techniques address issues related to variations in angles, hidden keypoints, curved samples, and local distortions.

Model Training and Ensemble Techniques: Machine learning models, such as CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks), are trained using the extracted features. Ensemble techniques, including bagging, boosting, or stacking, are employed to combine multiple models and improve classification accuracy.

Performance Evaluation: The performance of the image classification solution is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into the effectiveness of the implemented techniques and the overall performance of the system.

Repository Structure
The repository consists of the following files and directories:

data/: This directory contains the image dataset used for training and testing the classification models.( as it was too huge we dleted it but we still have in other repo)

preprocessing.ipynb: This script applies preprocessing techniques, such as Gaussian blur, median filtering, and denoising autoencoders, to the images in the dataset.

feature_extraction.ipynb: This script extracts features from the preprocessed images using SIFT, SURF, or CNN-based feature extraction techniques.

registration_transformation.ipynb: This script performs registration and transformation on the images using Homography-based registration and perspective transformation.

model_training.ipynb: (in feature extraction file): This script trains machine learning models, such as CNN, on the extracted features and implements ensemble techniques for improved classification accuracy.

evaluation.ipynb: (in feature extraction file): This script evaluates the performance of the image classification solution using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

README.md: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for running the different scripts.
